## Introduction

Snow crunched under her boots. The path had been worn by the crowd that stood in the distance. The walkway was awash in footprints like a falling star's tail, dangling behind the bright mass of people. Every so often, there would be a new flash of light from within the crowd. Then would come the "oooh"s and "aaah"s and short winded cheers. she struggled to contain a grin. the instinct to contain her smile was unecessary at the moment. For once in a very long time, she didn't need to hide enjoyment or facination.

Her friends were never going to believe her. Well, at least they would be her friends after tonight. She had heard them talking, daring each other to sneak out tonight.

Word spreads very quickly through a small town. It spreads even faster among children. It spreads with the utmost speed than it is forbidden. the juicy secrets were the ones worth telling. This wasn't a secret exactly. It was openly spoken about, but always about its evil and these conversations -- always led by adults -- came with threats and warnings. Kids will be kids. They hyped it up. The wandering carrige of zin was abhored by their parents. So, naturally, it was all the kids could find to talk about.

Anyone brave enough to see it would be the coolest. She was getting closer to the crowd now. Her red coat was frosted with the slowly falling snow. She slowed to a brisk walk now. The run she had maintained until now would be too noticible, she thought. She rubbed her hands together before stuffing them desperately into her the red pockets. Her fingers had lost feeling to the second knuckle. She had forgotten her gloves on the floor in her hasty escape. The little fluff balls that hung from the wrists dangled in the air, just lightly touching her beuro.

Now at the fringe of the crowd, she could feel the heat from the improvised stage. She snuck to the front and sat, cross legged. She was late, but excited. A man stood on stage. His legs seemed to attach to his torso at the wrong angle and made him seem perpetually off balance.

He choaked his neck with what looked at first like a scarf, but upon a closer glance revealed itself to be an amalgamation of lengths of tattered cloth. In fact, his whole attire was a haphazard collection of many layers to fight back the cold. His jacket(s) appeared as an onion, layered and layered further.

He continued something she had not heard the beginning of while she was pushing through the crowd.

"...is possible? Much more than you imagine. See."

The candle flames grew to a full hand. The crowd backed up, ooohing all the while. It grew brighter until she had to shield her eyes. Then, suddenly, all was blackness and shadows. There was almost no moon tonight. What little light there was barely lit a silouette of the performer. He stood motionless. All was silent. People lowered their hands and looked to the stage, barely making the thin man out. With all eyes on him, he turned slowly. Addressing everyone in the crowd slowly, purposefully. As he turned you could notice his cheeks were bulged out, as if impersonating a frog in mid-croak. He paused on her, winked, and turned his head upward. From his mouth, the flame of every candle burst forth. The column of flame fought within itself and at the blackness in the sky.  Embers began to fall back to the snow, lighting tiny flashes where they landed. One by one the candles were re-lit by the embers and the column faded and shrunk.

Cheers burst from the spectators. The thin man took a bow. He held his head to the ground for a full breath before lifting it to admire those who admired him. He mouthed 'Thank you's and waved. All at once, the grin left his face.

There was a shuffle behind her. She spun around, but only saw a flurry of legs. No. They couldn't be here. Her heart raced. Looking around in a panic she saw the performer retreat into his carriage. Now on her feet, she moved to run forward, but was pulled back sharply. There was a hand gripping her left arm. She was forced to the ground. Her coat sleeve was forced up to her shoulder. Attempts to turn away, to squirm, or to wiggle out were met with a knee in her neck. The other hand, this one adorned with a white glove, was pressed to her skin. Burning it. She tasted blood in the snow.

## The Town

A young girl sat by hersef. The rock beneath her had been warmed by the sun while she was in class. the sun now fell on her. It was low in the sky. With another hour, two at the most, it would fall below the treeling. Until then, she held a hand over her browline. There were maybe twenty children in the field with her. There were a few playing together under a nearby crooked tree. The rest were running in the tall grass. Chasing each other, calling out in the particular language they had created for this new game. This one was fast becoming a favorite.

One child would be chosen as the warlock. He had to chase the others and grab or touhc them to turn them into familiars. Another child was the cleric and was able to cleanse the familiars and, eventually, the warlock.

the end of the game was never in question. After all, the game was the entertaining part. Victory was short lived. It was an impedence on the flow of the game. The cleric would vanquish the warlock. Perhaps a noble speech would be iven over the body, burned with holy fire. Then they would help each other up and go on with another round.

They had asked her to play at first. No, asking is the wrong word. It assumes both parties are aware of the question. This was more one sided. Jamie only knew when they would turn to face her. There would be a revealing look to their eyes she had become very familiar with lately.

Eyebrows furrowed, even without the sun facing them. A slight scowl. Lips turned in contempt. A look one would give to a dog that had just been sick on your shoes.

Suddenly they would run at her. In her haste to flee, she would often trip. Only by thr fourth time did she notice the string raised just slightly off the ground. One of them must have snuck behind her through the grass and laid the trap. Then they would be upon her.

"Hold down her legs!"

"Watch her hands! Grab the wrists!"

Imobile, defenseless, she would yell out and curse them and at them. They only laughed. They always left. Last time, from somewhere nearby, they had brought forth a pot of holy water. She cried out with fresh passion and pulled against their arms and knees. There was no give. She was bound. The killing blow was aproaching slowly, sloshing with a sick splatter. The eldest held her head to the dirt by her hair. With the pot above her head, she drew in a breath. Some by her side struck her hard in the gut, losing her much needed air and emptying her lungs. The water fell. It wreaked of urine and dirt.

They released her and scattered. She lay there, the sun now below the trees, panting for air. Tears bled into the mud and the rest of the filth on her face. The wind, suddenly noticable with her clothes soaked through, picked up. She brought her legs to her ches tand sat up. It was getting dark, but it wasn't dark enough.

There would surely be some other torment waiting for her along the roads. But not for long. Under the stars she would be invincible -- untouchable. The darkness was what they said gave her strength. Sunlight, so righteous, sapped her strength. Moonlight was enough, but just barely. There would be no moon tonight. She would be left alone.

The saftey of night was still a ways off. She wrapped her arms around her legs. Her hands gripped her forearms. She brought her right hand into her drenched coat sleve. Fingers traced along the raised skin. Her scar. Her mark. Her curse. another breeze blew across her face. Still wet. She was still crying.

Her family didn't hear the door open and close. She was hoping they wouldn't. They didn't worry about her. She had no curfew, like th eother kids. Father had long since stopped scolding her. She was beyond saving. Words were rarely exchanged between them now. Even rarer was it for Jamie to talk with her mother. they communicated in looks and glances. Mother would track Jamie as she crossed the room. Or ignore her. It varied from night to night. Jamie tended to reaquaint herself with her feet whenever she was unfortunate enough to be around either of them.

The house was silent. Softly glowing embers sat among the grey heaps in the fireplace. The room was still warm. Although no longer dripping, her boat was still soaked through. Most of her clothes were. Scratch that. They all were. Her feet were dry when she started home, but had recieved as a kind gift from coat, pants, and underwear, the dampness and stink as it dripped down.

She grabbed an empty pot from beside the doorway. Water from the stream behind the house still held a hint of warmpth. She filled the pot and pured her clothes into it. bare to the darkness, she lowered herself into the water and submerged her head. The smell and salt washed away with her scrubbing. The current caried away the plauged water. Finished, she allowed the water to carry her as well. She floated downstream just barely below the surface, lifelessly still. She swam back to shore and sat, cross legged, on a wooden mat.

Even though the moon was hidden, the sky was in no way black. At least, not fully. Lifting her hand above her, between her eye and the white-dotted emptiness, she drew connections between the stars.

The largest was the Flotilla -- a collection of two dozen plus one or two just above the southern horizon. Triangular sails held strong over the half-moon ships. As the summer faded to winter, the ships would sink beneath the horizon. Until then, they took port and were merry. The air around her held a chill that hinted to their impending quest to another land. The ships were once merchant vessels, but a recent order by the King had re-outfitted them as battleships.

The King held the center of the summer sky. A ruler by symbol, he appeared as seven points arranged in a crown. To his left sat the Jester. To his right, the Tempter. A hold over from her days of conviction, the Tempter and Jester were put against each other by the King. They both attempted to sway the King. Ever faithful, the Knight stood north of the King. He was a sword, as all good knights are judged by. He stood between the Terror and the Kingdom.

Along the northern edge of the sky, full from one side to the other, was a scattered mass of stars that she could never imagine into forms. They had always reminded her of small fires, like an army making camp for the night. She hadn't checked in on the Kingdom in a long time. It was calming to see the familiar faces. Her attention had been drawn to the ground for too long. After another long breath, she drew her clothes out of the pot. One after another, she dunked each piece back into the river and walked to hang it on her clothesline.

She had her own of a lot of things. Her parents had quickly distanced themselves from her after she returned to town marked. She was tainted, they said. Tempted and fallen to flashy magic -- the ultimate crime of the soul, a blasphemous upheaval of God's pre-ordained universal order. Her interest alone was enough to make them wary of her when she was young. The mark was their worst fears made flesh. All the horrors their church warned of were present in that single mark, burned solemly into her left arm. They would have gotten a new daughter if they could, but they would have been even further estracised if her mother became pregnant again. So alone they were. More alone than they were before Jamie had been born.

Dawn and Arthur had been wed some sixteen years ago. It had been a quaint ceremony. Only nearby family and a few choice friends had arrived for the occasion. A small tree tried feebly to provide shade to the weary guests, but it could not. The cleric had waited with Arthur at the end of a makeshift grass walkway and wiped his brow. His white regalia didn't stop the heat, and there was no wind to aid him. Arthur stood ridgid wearing the only good clothes his family owned. A light-brown coat matched the slightly darker pants. He had maintained that this shift in color was always due to the lighting whenever he had seen the garments worn. His grand father had been married in these clothes.

Sun above had cast a shadow on the pants, or so he had explained it to himself. Standing in them now, with his two legs filling the slightly-darker material, he knew it was not a trick of the light. The coat and pants must have belonged to two different sets. They were step-brothers. Or maybe one had been adopted. He smoothed the coat against his chest as Dawn's father led her up towards him. Then there was cheering and weeping and all the things that are expected of a wedding. There was a honeymoon, however short-lived it was. Arthur wasn't able to take more than a few days off work.

It wasn't a year before Dawn was showing. She became the darling of the women around town, as all the soon-to-be mothers did. Along with the child to care for, she also had the house. Throughout her pregnancy she kept the place clean and working. Dinner was always ready on time. Although Arthur did help occasionally, he was out of the house more and more in preparation for the coming baby. He would leave before the sun had risen, only to be missing for days at a time. With odd jobs around the town, and many years of work in Mr. Duglas' fields, he had bought a wagon and a horse. He was the only one in the few nearby towns to have one, and made good money transporting goods between them. As Dawn got further along, he took more jobs for transports to the capital, Terenon.

The baby was still-born.

Two years later, with bitter tears to mark the unmarked wounds, Dawn was again with child. The women around town flocked to her again, but this time with noticable reservation. There were stories about dead children that were never spoken of in front of the parents. The stories lived on the lips of those just out of earshot. Stories of depravity. Stories of sin. Of unworthiness and broken pacts with the Supreme. Why else would the child not move; not cry; not warm his mother's arms? The clerics read scripture each week and kept a wary eye on the troubled couple. If the last one had been as it was - stolen by darkness even in the light of birth; and if the next was born alive despite those circumstances, what secrets did the new child hold that could keep back death where its brother could not?

Sunlight was powerless to wake Jamie. She dozed right through its impressive rise. She turned her head from it when her windowsil ceased to shield her tired eyes. With blanket piled high at her back, she slept on. Her mother called up to her, half-heartedly. Breakfast was ready and hot. Still, Jamie slept. Dawn glanced to the staircase, but made no move towards it. The breakfast would get cold as it sat untouched on the table as it did most mornings. Arthur was already out. Dawn followed a few minutes later after calling out one last time. Jamie slept on.

She slept, firmly wrapped in the blankets she had twisted around herself during a particularly startling dream, until there was a knock at her window. The eastern face of the house had no wood cris-crossing it like the Madlow's house had. It didn't have a balcony for her room. There was no room. All the available space had been forcably conqured by a stunningly sturdy ivy. The vines that snaked the wall were thick around as small trees. It was this ivy that Tom had used to climb to Jamies window, which he continued to knock on. He could see Jamie sleeping not far from the inside of the window.

After a minute, it was clear that a new approach was needed. To this end, Tom deftly opened the window and jumped inside - crashing down onto the sleeping girl in a fit of laughter.

"Wake up, ya sleeping log! You've gone and made us late, ya know?"

There is only so much you can do to retaliate when you're pre-wrapped and delerious, but she gave it a good shot. Tom was faster. He rolled twice on her before jumping down to the floor.

"Get yourself up or there'll be no breakfast!"

And with that, he was out the door and down the stairs. Jamie was quick when she needed to be; a bittersweet gift from the torment she recieved around town. However, it worked to her advantage now. Before Tom could take the first bite she had slammed into him from the side and knocked the fork from his hand.

"Don't even think about it!"

They tumbled to the floor, both laughing this time. She stood and dusted her nightgown off, victorious.

"Dang Jaim, that was too much! You broke my clavis."
"Aww. Is baby broken?"
"Lay off and eat up. We're already too late." Tom raised himself to his feet.

Breakfast was a bowl of slop. Oatmeal, if her mother was to be trusted. This wasn't often the case. Slop it was. Jamie ate it greedily. Last night's torments had left her more ravenous than she thought.

They were soon walking just fast enough to be concidered a slow run. Tom lagged behind by a few feet. His eyes came up to Jamie's nose, and most of his height was in his chest. His legs tumbled beneath him, kicking up dust along the baren road. They dodged the ruts wagon ruts and kept their eyes forward. Tom finally broached the question he had been holding since he knocked on her window:

"Up late last night?"
Jamie was silent. Her eyes fell to the road, watching the ground just before her feet.
"No! Not that bad, right? I was only gone one day!"
"There was holy water this time."
Tom shuddered, "Sorry Jaim."
"No, you can't be there all the time."
"How many of them did ya get," he caught up and punched her arm, hoping for a good answer.
Jamie's face rose back to the horizon. "Nope. I freaked two of them out on the way home afterward though." Her mouth turned up into a grin.
Tom ignored the grin. She was much worse at lying with her eyes.
