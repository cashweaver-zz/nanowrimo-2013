## Introduction

Snow crunched under her boots. The path had been worn by the crowd that stood in the distance. The walkway was awash in footprints like a falling star's tail, dangling behind the bright mass of people. Every so often, there would be a new flash of light from within the crowd. Then would come the "oooh"s and "aaah"s and short winded cheers. she struggled to contain a grin. the instinct to contain her smile was unecessary at the moment. For once in a very long time, she didn't need to hide enjoyment or facination.

Her friends were never going to believe her. Well, at least they would be her friends after tonight. She had heard them talking, daring each other to sneak out tonight.

Word spreads very quickly through a small town. It spreads even faster among children. It spreads with the utmost speed than it is forbidden. the juicy secrets were the ones worth telling. This wasn't a secret exactly. It was openly spoken about, but always about its evil and these conversations -- always led by adults -- came with threats and warnings. Kids will be kids. They hyped it up. The wandering carrige of zin was abhored by their parents. So, naturally, it was all the kids could find to talk about.

Anyone brave enough to see it would be the coolest. She was getting closer to the crowd now. Her red coat was frosted with the slowly falling snow. She slowed to a brisk walk now. The run she had maintained until now would be too noticible, she thought. She rubbed her hands together before stuffing them desperately into her the red pockets. Her fingers had lost feeling to the second knuckle. She had forgotten her gloves on the floor in her hasty escape. The little fluff balls that hung from the wrists dangled in the air, just lightly touching her beuro.

Now at the fringe of the crowd, she could feel the heat from the improvised stage. She snuck to the front and sat, cross legged. She was late, but excited. A man stood on stage. His legs seemed to attach to his torso at the wrong angle and made him seem perpetually off balance.

He choaked his neck with what looked at first like a scarf, but upon a closer glance revealed itself to be an amalgamation of lengths of tattered cloth. In fact, his whole attire was a haphazard collection of many layers to fight back the cold. His jacket(s) appeared as an onion, layered and layered further.

He continued something she had not heard the beginning of while she was pushing through the crowd.

"...is possible? Much more than you imagine. See."

The candle flames grew to a full hand. The crowd backed up, ooohing all the while. It grew brighter until she had to shield her eyes. Then, suddenly, all was blackness and shadows. There was almost no moon tonight. What little light there was barely lit a silouette of the performer. He stood motionless. All was silent. People lowered their hands and looked to the stage, barely making the thin man out. With all eyes on him, he turned slowly. Addressing everyone in the crowd slowly, purposefully. As he turned you could notice his cheeks were bulged out, as if impersonating a frog in mid-croak. He paused on her, winked, and turned his head upward. From his mouth, the flame of every candle burst forth. The column of flame fought within itself and at the blackness in the sky.  Embers began to fall back to the snow, lighting tiny flashes where they landed. One by one the candles were re-lit by the embers and the column faded and shrunk.

Cheers burst from the spectators. The thin man took a bow. He held his head to the ground for a full breath before lifting it to admire those who admired him. He mouthed 'Thank you's and waved. All at once, the grin left his face.

There was a shuffle behind her. She spun around, but only saw a flurry of legs. No. They couldn't be here. Her heart raced. Looking around in a panic she saw the performer retreat into his carriage. Now on her feet, she moved to run forward, but was pulled back sharply. There was a hand gripping her left arm. She was forced to the ground. Her coat sleeve was forced up to her shoulder. Attempts to turn away, to squirm, or to wiggle out were met with a knee in her neck. The other hand, this one adorned with a white glove, was pressed to her skin. Burning it. She tasted blood in the snow.
